# Full Query Logging

## Learn how to use full query logging in Apache CassandraÂ®

Cassandra 4.x full query logging enables you to get the exact CQL query strings used by your client applications. This information can be used for:
- Analyzing poorly performing queries 
- Debugging queries that are producing incorrect results
- Live traffic capture and replay
- Troubleshooting/Debugging

**In this hands-on lab, you will:**
- Enable and disable full query logging statically (in `cassandra.yaml`) and dynamically (using `nodetool`)
- Learn features of the full query logging tool `fqltool`
- Read and interpret full query logs

_This hands-on lab is available on our [https://www.datastax.com/learn/whats-new-for-cassandra-4](https://www.datastax.com/learn/whats-new-for-cassandra-4) site, where you can find many more resources to help you succeed with Apache Cassandra._
